# 🚖 Ola Data Analytics Project

A comprehensive data analysis project focused on Ola Cab’s ride data, designed to deliver actionable business insights through interactive dashboards and visual analytics. This project utilizes Power BI, PostgreSQL, and Excel to transform raw data into strategic information for decision-making.


## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze ride-level data to uncover trends in revenue, customer behavior, and operational performance, while identifying key areas of improvement such as incomplete rides and city-wise demand.


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Power BI – For dashboard development and interactive visualizations  
- Microsoft Excel – For data preprocessing and exploratory analysis  
- PostgreSQL – For SQL-based data querying and transformation  
- DAX – For creating custom KPIs and measures  
- Data Cleaning & Modeling – In Power BI and Excel


## 📊 Key Features

- Dynamic Dashboards: Interactive visuals with filters for ride status, city, and payment type  
- KPI Tracking: Metrics on total rides, revenue, cancellations, distance, and more  
- Revenue Analysis: Time-series trends, peak periods, and city-wise earnings breakdown  
- Incomplete Ride Insights: Cancellations and failure reasons visualized for operational improvement  
- Customer Patterns: Usage frequency, engagement levels, and preferred payment modes



## 🔍 Insights & Outcomes

- Identified top-performing cities based on ride count and revenue
- Detected peak demand hours and low-performance time slots
- Analyzed cancellation patterns to suggest service improvements
- Delivered visual summaries for executive-level reporting



## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download and open the `.pbix` file in [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/)
2. Use the slicers to explore metrics by city, ride status, and payment type
3. Optionally, review the `.sql` file to understand or reuse PostgreSQL queries
4. Hover over visuals for detailed insights and tooltips




## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how PostgreSQL-based querying combined with Power BI dashboards can turn transportation data into valuable, decision-ready business insights. It reflects best practices in SQL, data storytelling, and visual analytics.
